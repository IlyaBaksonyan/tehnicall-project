  Welcome to the "tehnicall-project," a mock project created during my studies at the technical college to learn and practice Vue.js development. Before this, I had experience building small websites solely focusing on design and lacking JavaScript implementation. As a result, the structure of this project is far from ideal, containing a myriad of folder and code organization issues. The codebase is riddled with crutch solutions, that's why variables everywhere and for the THREE.js library are often defined with 'any' types due to the lack of proper typings. This project serves as a testament to my journey from a novice developer to improving my skills and understanding better coding practices.
